# Quantiles-in-Non-parametric-Regression-Local-Constant-Estimators-

This is an Under Graduate Project I did at IITK.

The project is aimed at exploring two local constant estimators for non-parametric regression namely <b> Nadaraya Watson estimator </b> and <b> Local Constant Quantile estimator </b>. The main aim of the project is to do empirical comparison of the two methods on some practical data set.

The project is divided into 3 main parts:

1) Parametric v/s Non-parametric approach
2) Choice of Bandwidth
3) Empirical Comparison b/w the two local constant estimators

The relevant <b> books </b> and <b> research papers </b> have been attached.

<b> Codes </b> and <b> Graphs </b> are present in respective folders
